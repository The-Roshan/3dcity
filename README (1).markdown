# Hyper-Realistic Ultra-Expensive Village Scene

## Overview
This project is a WebGL-based 3D visualization of a luxurious, animated village scene built using Three.js. The scene features opulent elements like marble buildings, golden statues, crystal fountains, and animated objects such as hot air balloons, birds, and watermills, creating a visually stunning and interactive experience.

## Features
- **Luxurious Environment**: Includes marble houses, platinum huts, sapphire lakes, and emerald vineyards.
- **Animated Elements**: Dynamic animations for trees, animals (cows, goats, chickens), people, carriages, ships, windmills, watermills, fountains, balloons, clouds, birds, and a pulsating sun.
- **Interactive Controls**: OrbitControls allow users to pan, zoom, and rotate the camera to explore the scene.
- **High-Quality Rendering**: Utilizes Three.js with soft shadows, high-resolution shadow maps, and antialiasing for a polished look.
- **Responsive Design**: Adapts to different screen sizes with a resize handler.
- **Error Handling**: Checks for WebGL support and provides fallback messages for unsupported browsers.

## Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge) with WebGL support.
- Internet connection to load Three.js and OrbitControls from CDNs.

## Setup
1. **Clone or Download**: Obtain the project files, including `index.html` and `LICENSE.md`.
2. **Host Locally**:
   - Place the files in a directory.
   - Use a local server (e.g., `python -m http.server` or `npx serve`) to serve the files, as some browsers require a server for WebGL applications.
3. **Open in Browser**: Navigate to the hosted URL (e.g., `http://localhost:8000`) or open `index.html` directly in a browser if permitted.

## Usage
- **Navigation**: Use the mouse to rotate (left-click and drag), pan (right-click and drag), and zoom (scroll wheel) the camera.
- **View Animations**: Observe dynamic elements like moving animals, rotating windmill blades, and floating balloons.
- **Error Handling**: If WebGL is not supported, a message will display. Check the browser console (F12) for any errors.
